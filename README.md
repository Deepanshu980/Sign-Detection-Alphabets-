# 🔤 Alphabet Hand Sign Detection using CNN

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect and classify **hand sign alphabets (A–Z)** from images.  
It is useful for **sign language recognition**, **gesture-based interaction**, and **assistive communication systems**.

## 📌 Features

- Alphabet hand sign classification (A–Z)(some are missing I update after sometime)
- CNN-based deep learning model
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Training and validation with labeled alphabet datasets
- High accuracy and stable training performance

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The CNN model includes:
- Convolutional layers (Conv2D) for feature extraction
- MaxPooling layers for spatial reduction
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Fully connected Dense layers
- Softmax activation for 26 alphabet classes (A–Z)
